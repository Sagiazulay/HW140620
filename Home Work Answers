1. תכנות מונחה עצמים או בשמו OOP - Object Oriented Programming
הוא תכנות בצורת בניית עצמים מנחים ושימוש בהם תוך כדי כך שכל אחד מהם עומד בפני עמצו ויכולים לתקשר אחד בין השני.

2. class - A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects
Objects - An object is an instance of a class.

3. creating an Object. To create a new object we use the word "new" and give the object a name.

4. The "C" language in NOT OOP. But The "C++" IS OOP.

5.Inheritance means that we can inherit fields and methods from one class to another.
It is helpful because if we have some classes that have a similar fields and methods with a litlle changes
we can use (inherit)the code that we already wrote and just add the changes that we want.

6.Abstract class - is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
Abstarct Method - can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the derived class (inherited from).

7.ToStrting - Is a way to return a string fron inside the Object.
We can use it when we want to get information from the object.
The ToString must come with an Override because the visual studio already has inside it a ToString function.
